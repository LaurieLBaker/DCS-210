# DCS 210 Programming for Data Analysis and Visualization

## Course Description
Hello and welcome to **DCS 210. Programming for Data Analysis and Visualisation**. This course will introduce students to data analysis and visualization with R. As an introduction to programming course, everyone is welcome. By the end of the course students will be able to gain insight from data, reproducibly (with literate programming and version control) and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques.

The course content is organized in five units:
 
- **Unit 1 - Hello world:** This unit is an introduction to the content, pedagogy, and toolkit of the course.
- **Unit 2 - Exploring data:** This unit focuses on data visualization and data wrangling. Specifically we cover fundamentals of data and data visualization, confounding variables, and Simpson’s paradox as well as the concept of tidy data, data import, data cleaning, and data curation. We end the unit with web scraping and introduce the idea of iteration in preparation for the next unit. Also in this unit students are introduced to the toolkit: R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git, and GitHub.
- **Unit 3 - Data science ethics:** In this unit we discuss misrepresentation of findings, particularly in data visualisations, breaches of data privacy, and algorithmic bias.
- **Unit 4 - Making rigorous conclusions:** In this unit we introduce modelling and statistical inference for making data-based conclusions. We discuss building, interpreting, and selecting models, visualizing interaction effects, and prediction and model validation. Statistical inference is introduced from a simulation based perspective, and the Central Limit Theorem is discussed very briefly to lay the foundation for future coursework in statistics.
- **Unit 5 - Looking forward:** In the last unit we will explore a series of short modules such as interactive reporting and visualization with Shiny, text analysis, creating maps, and machine learning. The modules offered at the end of the course will depend on our progress and how much time we have left in the semester.
