# DCS 210. Programming for Data Analysis and Visualisation

Hello and welcome to **DCS 210. Programming for Data Analysis and Visualisation**. This course will introduce students to data analysis and visualization with R. As an introduction to programming course, everyone is welcome. By the end of the course students will be able to gain insight from data, reproducibly (with literate programming and version control) and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques.

## Data Science Course in a Box

Data Science in a Box contains the materials required to teach (or learn from) an introductory data science course using R, all of which are freely-available and open-source.
They include course materials such as slide decks, homework assignments, guided labs, sample exams, a final project assignment, as well as materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and course logistics.

See [datasciencebox.org](https://datasciencebox.org/) for everything you need to know about the project!

## Questions, bugs, feature requests

You can file an issue to get help, report a bug, or make a feature request.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version.
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`.
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed.
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search *all* issues in the repo, open or closed.

If your issue involves R code, please make a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package.
If you haven't heard of or used reprex before, you're in for a treat!
Seriously, reprex will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about).
For additional reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)
section of the tidyverse site.
