## Shiny

.pull-left[
- Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R
- You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards
- You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions
- Learn more at [shiny.rstudio.com](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

## High level view

- Every Shiny app has a webpage that the user visits, and behind this webpage there is a computer that serves this webpage by running R

- When running your app locally, the computer serving your app is your computer

- When your app is deployed, the computer serving your app is a web server

What does the app do?

# Anatomy of a Shiny app

## What's in a Shiny app

.pull-left[

```{r shiny_ex, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage()

server <- function(input, output){}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


]

.pull-right[

- **User interface (ui)** controls the layout and appearance of the app.
- **Server function (server)** contains instructions needed to build the app

]

---

## Inputs  

- To make the app interactive, you need an **input** that the user can change  
- Shiny includes a selection of functions for this called **widgets**.

]

---

## Inputs

- Inputs are used in the **ui** to set the options for the user to interact with. 

``` {r widgets, echo=FALSE}
widgets <- data.frame(Name = c("actionButton()", 
                               "checkboxInput()",
                               "checkboxGroupInput()",
                               "dateInput()", 
                               "dateRangeInput()", 
                               "numericInput()", 
                               "radioButtons()",
                               "selectInput()", 
                               "sliderInput()", 
                               "textInput()"),
                      Description = c("a button click input", 
                                      "a single checkbox",
                                      "a set of checkboxes where multiple can be selected", 
                                      "a calendar for date selection",
                                      "a pair of calendars for start and end date selection",
                                      "a free-text for numbers", 
                                      "a set of buttons where only 1 can be selected",
                                      "a dropdown menu", 
                                      "a slider bar", 
                                      "a free-text for letters/words"))

DT::datatable(widgets,
              options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

---

## Outputs

- An **output** is required to show the user the effects of their **input**
- ``render()`` is used in the **server** to generate the output
- ``output()`` is used in the **ui** to display the output to the user

``` {r, echo=FALSE}
outputs <- data.frame("render" = c("renderImage()",
                                 "renderPlot()",
                                 "renderPrint()",
                                 "renderTable()",
                                 "DT::renderDataTable()",
                                 "renderText()",
                                 "rendeerUI()"),
                      "output"=c("imageOutput()",
                                 "plotOutput()",
                                 "verbatimTextOutput()",
                                 "tableOutput()",
                                 "dataTableOutput()",
                                 "textOutput()",
                                 "uiOutput() or htmlOutput()"),
                      "Produces" = c("an image",
                                     "a plot/map",
                                     "any printed output formatted as code",
                                     "a table", 
                                     "an interactable table",
                                     "any character string formatted to match app",
                                     "any character string formatted with raw HTML code"))

DT::datatable(outputs,
              options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

## The User Interface (ui)

- Spot the 4 widgets that allow the user to interact with the app. What do they do?

]

## Parts of the user interface

- The user interface is divided into 3 parts: a title panel, a main panel, and a side bar panel. 
- When you construct the user interface you can choose your layout.

```{r picture-side-panel, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/parts_shiny_app.jpg")
```
